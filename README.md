**Programming for Data Analysis:** 

This Jupyter Notebook has been created to simulate a data set of real-world data using the numpy.random packge in Python. This notebook will investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. While also synthesising/simulating the data set as closely matching the properties as possible.

**Lecturer:** Dr. Brian McGinley

## 1 Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the Project for the Programming for Data Analysis module a Jupyter Notebook has been created to simulate a data set of real-world data using the *numpy.random* packge in Python. This notebook will investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. While also synthesising/simulating the data set as closely matching the properties as possible.
This analysis will be conducted through a Jupyter Notebook which will contain markdown text, images, Python code and Plots. 

## 2 Project Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Project Repository is the source where all the work associated with
the project will be stored. It contains the following files and can be
located [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project):

  **File**    |     **Description**
  ---------   |   --------------------------------------------------------
  .gitignore | A Text File explicitly explaining to Git which files or folders to ignore in the Assignment
  Project Instructions.pdf | A PDF copy of the Poject Instructions
  LICENSE     |    MIT License for the project
  Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project.ipynb | Jupyter Notebook created to  in Python

## 3  Real-World Phenomenon
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For the purpose of this project the author chose the field of X for the simulation a real-world phenomenon. This is due to the authors 

## 4 Problem Statement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the project, the student was given a set of instructions which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project/blob/main/Project%20Instructions.pdf). As seen, within the instructions a problem statement was printed. It stated that for this project the student must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of their choosing. The student may pick any phenomenon they wish and may one of interest to the student in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, the studnet should model and synthesise such data using Python. The instructions suggest the the *numpy.random* package is used for this. Specifically, the instruction state the project should:
* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

## 5 User Guide
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section will describe the steps required to download and run the files in the repository.

### 5.1 Downloading the Repository
The repository is stored at the following: https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project

To download the repository, do the following:
1.  Click on the above link to open the repository
2.  Once in the repository, click on the green “clone or download” button on the right side of the screen.
3.  Select "Download ZIP". This will open a prompt allowing you to save the file to a desired location on your computer.
4.  Navigate to where  the ZIP files are located on your computer and extract the compressed (.zip) files.

### 5.2 Running the Program
Once the repository has been downloaded, you will need to ensure that you are running it in the correct environment. It should be noted that this repository has been written using Python 3.8.2 and consequently it will require a Python version of 3.7 at a minimum to run as designed. The repository also requires a number of external Python libraries [seen below](#5.3-Libaries) to execute correctly. Once the correct version of Python has been installed complete with necessary libraries and the ZIP has been downloaded and extracted the user can run the program. The running of any of the programs from the command line can be executed as follows:
1.  Open a command prompt (cmd) or equivalent on your computer.([Cmdr](https://cmder.net) is recommended for Windows computers, Mac Computers via the terminal)
2.  Navigate to the desired location through the use of the change directory (cd) command.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook by typing the following at the command prompt (do not close the command prompt window throughout):
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. A notebook server should automatically launch in your default web browser (URL should be http://localhost:8888). If this does not happen, read the command prompt output. You can copy and paste the above URL into your web browser to access Jupyter Notebook.
6. Using the menu on the left side of the page, double click the jupyter notebook file:
```
Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project.ipynb
```
7. The notebook should open in a new tab. You can run each cell with the keyboard shortcut SHIFT+ENTER, alternatively use the "play" button on the menu bar. Please note that certain cells must be run before others e.g. the cells importing the various Python libraries. You may find it convenient to use the "Run all Cells" option in the "Run" dropdown menu.

### 5.3 Libraries
The following Python libraries were used in the writing of the projects code and are required to successfully run the programs:
* [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) - Used for mathematical functions in the [Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project/blob/main/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project.ipynb) notebook.
* [Matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) - Used for the manipulation of elements and the creation of certain plots graphs and plots within the [Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project/blob/main/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project.ipynb) - Used for the creation and manipulation of all plots in the [Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project/blob/main/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project.ipynb).
